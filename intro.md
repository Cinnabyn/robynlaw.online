<h3>Current project: Making addons for Immersive Railroading</h3>
<p>In my spare time, I've been learning how to integrate 3D models into Minecraft via a mod called Immersive Railroading. This involved creating a mesh, texturing the mesh, giving it properties via json and extensive playtesting/bugfixing.</p>
